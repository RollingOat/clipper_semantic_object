CLIPPER: A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Robust Data Association
================================================================

Data association is a fundamental problem in robotics and autonomy. CLIPPER provides a framework for robust, pairwise data association and is applicable in a wide variety of problems (e.g., point cloud registration, sensor calibration, place recognition, etc.). By leveraging the notion of *geometric consistency*, a graph is formed and the data association problem is reduced to the [maximum clique problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem). This NP-hard problem has been studied in many fields, including data association, and solutions techniques are either exact (and not scalable) or approximate (and potentially imprecise). CLIPPER relaxes this problem in a way that (1) **allows guarantees** to be made on the solution of the problem and (2) is applicable to weighted graphs, avoiding the loss of information due to binarization which is common in other data association work. These features allow CLIPPER to achieve high performance, even in the presence of extreme outliers.

This repo provides both MATLAB and C++ implementations of the CLIPPER framework. In addition, Python bindings, Python, C++, and MATLAB examples are included.

## Getting Started

After cloning this repo, please build using `cmake`:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Once successful, the C++ tests can be run with `./test/tests` (if `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` is added to `cmake ..` command).

### Python Bindings

If Python bindings are built (see configuration options below), then the `clipper` Python module will need to be installed before using. This can be done with

```bash
$ cd build
$ make pip-install

# or directly using pip (e.g., to control which python version)
$ python3 -m pip install build/bindings/python # 'python3 -m' ensures appropriate pip version is used
```

***Note**: if using Python2 (e.g., < ROS Noetic), you must tell pybind11 to use Python2.7. Do this with adding the flag `-DPYBIND11_PYTHON_VERSION=2.7` to the `cmake ..` command. You may have to remove your `build` directory and start over to ensure nothing is cached. You should see that pybind11 finds a Python2.7 interpreter and libraries.*

A Python example notebook can be found in [`examples`](examples/python).

### MATLAB Bindings

If MATLAB is installed on your computer and MATLAB bindings are requested (see configuration options below), then `cmake` will attempt to find your MATLAB installation and subsequently generate a set of MEX files so that CLIPPER can be used in MATLAB.

Note that in addition to the C++/MEX version of CLIPPER's dense cluster finder, we provide a reference MATLAB version of our projected gradient ascent approach to finding dense clusters.

Please find MATLAB examples [`here`](examples/matlab).

### Configuring the Build

The following `cmake` options are available when building CLIPPER:

| Option                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                     | Default |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `BUILD_BINDINGS_PYTHON` | Uses [`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) to create Python bindings for CLIPPER                                                                                     | `ON`    |
| `BUILD_BINDINGS_MATLAB` | Attempts to build MEX files which are required for the MATLAB examples. A MATLAB installation is required. Gracefully fails if not found.                                     | `OFF`    |
| `BUILD_TESTS`           | Builds C++ tests                                                                                                                                                                | `OFF`    |
| `BUILD_BENCHMARKS`      | Builds C++ timing benchmarks                                                                                                                                                                | `OFF`    |
| `ENABLE_MKL`            | Attempts to use [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html) (if installed) with Eigen for accelerated linear algebra. | `OFF`   |
| `ENABLE_BLAS`           | Attempts to use a BLAS with Eigen for accelerated linear algebra.                                                                                                               | `OFF`   |

**Note:** The options `ENABLE_MKL` and `ENABLE_BLAS` are mutually exclusive.

These `cmake` options can be set using the syntax `cmake -DENABLE_MKL=ON ..` or using the `ccmake .` command (both from the `build` dir).

### Performance with MKL vs BLAS

On Intel CPUs, MKL should be preferred as it offers superior performance over other general BLAS packages. Also note that on Ubuntu, OpenBLAS (`sudo apt install libopenblas-dev`) provides better performance than the default installed `blas`.

With MKL, we have found an almost 2x improvement in runtime over the MATLAB implementation. On an i9, the C++/MKL implementation can solve problems with 1000 associations in 70 ms.

**Note:** Currently, MATLAB bindings do not work if either BLAS or MKL are enabled. Python bindings do not work if MKL is enabled.

### Including in Another C++ Project

A simple way to include `clipper` as a shared library in another C++ project is via `cmake`. This method will automatically clone and build `clipper`, making the resulting library accessible in your main project. In the project `CMakeLists.txt` you can add

```cmake
set(CLIPPER_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/clipper-download" CACHE INTERNAL "CLIPPER build dir" FORCE)
set(BUILD_BINDINGS_MATLAB OFF CACHE BOOL "")
set(BUILD_TESTS OFF CACHE BOOL "")
set(ENABLE_MKL OFF CACHE BOOL "")
set(ENABLE_BLAS OFF CACHE BOOL "")
configure_file(cmake/clipper.cmake.in ${CLIPPER_DIR}/CMakeLists.txt IMMEDIATE @ONLY)
execute_process(COMMAND "${CMAKE_COMMAND}" -G "${CMAKE_GENERATOR}" . WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CLIPPER_DIR})
execute_process(COMMAND "${CMAKE_COMMAND}" --build . WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CLIPPER_DIR})
add_subdirectory(${CLIPPER_DIR}/src ${CLIPPER_DIR}/build)
```

where `cmake/clipper.cmake.in` looks like

```cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(clipper-download NONE)

include(ExternalProject)
ExternalProject_Add(clipper
    GIT_REPOSITORY      "https://github.com/mit-acl/clipper"
    GIT_TAG             main
    SOURCE_DIR          "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/src"
    BINARY_DIR          "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/build"
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND   ""
    BUILD_COMMAND       ""
    INSTALL_COMMAND     ""
    TEST_COMMAND        ""
)
```

Then, you can link your project with `clipper` using the syntax `target_link_libraries(yourproject clipper)`.
